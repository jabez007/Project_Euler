# Project Euler (Haskell)

## Synopsis
These are my solutions for the problems of Project Euler done in Haskell.


## Motivation
I'm using my love of mathematics to help me learn the basics of Haskell.
Hopefully, through this and [Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com) 
I'll have a decent base to build real Haskell applications from.
