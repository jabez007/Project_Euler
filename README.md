# Project Euler

## Synopsis
These are my solutions for the problems of Project Euler done in various programming languages.
See the different branches of this repository for the solutions done in that language.

## Motivation
I'm combining my love of mathematics with my desire to improve my programming skills and knowledge of Git.
Using the structure of this repository I hope to practice some of the different Git commands and operations.
